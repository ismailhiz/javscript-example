# üìù JavaScript Example

This repository contains a collection of small tasks and projects I have worked on while reviewing and strengthening my knowledge in JavaScript. The tasks are categorized based on different concepts and techniques in JavaScript, helping me solidify my understanding and gain practical experience.

## üöÄ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to showcase various JavaScript tasks, each targeting a specific topic or concept. These examples will help both beginners and those looking to improve their JavaScript skills with hands-on projects.

## üìö Topics Covered

- **Variables & Data Types:** Tasks related to defining variables, understanding data types, and working with different data structures.
- **Control Flow:** Examples demonstrating conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops such as `for` and `while`.
- **Functions:** Practice with creating and invoking functions, understanding function scope, and using function expressions.
- **Arrays & Objects:** Tasks that involve working with arrays, objects, and their methods to manipulate data.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Small projects that interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update web content.
- **Event Handling:** Examples showcasing event listeners and handling user input through forms and buttons.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Tasks involving Promises, `async`/`await`, and handling asynchronous operations.
